% Please do not remove any of the section headings below

\section{Building a Fat-tree Data Center Network in Mininet}

% Start your writing here, feel free to include subsections to structure your report if needed
% Please remove the note below in your submission
\note{Please explain the high-level idea.}

\section{Implementing Shortest-Path Routing in the Fat-tree Network}

% Start your writing here, feel free to include subsections to structure your report if needed
% Please remove the note below in your submission
\note{Please explain the high-level idea, as well as important details in your implementation.}

\section{Implementing Two-Level Routing in the Fat-tree Network}

% Start your writing here, feel free to include subsections to structure your report if needed
% Please remove the note below in your submission
\note{Please explain the high-level idea, as well as important details in your implementation. If a similar part has already been mentioned in last section, you do not have to repeat the same and can simply refer to it here.}

\section{Comparing the Performance of the Two Routing Schemes}

% Start your writing here, feel free to include subsections to structure your report if needed
% Please remove the note below in your submission
\note{Please explain the design of your experiment, the setup, and parameters. Also, please include the reasoning of your design (answers to questions like why this particular experiment can best show the performance difference between the two routing schemes, why the parameters have to be set that way). Then, please include your experiment results, discuss the results, and try to make conclusions from the results.}
